# Open Source Contributions

This repo lists all of my contributions to open-source projects and endeavours. Open-source projects are projects that are available for members of the public to duplicate and modify (with permission). This is a great way for people who would like to work in the data industry to gain expereince in contributing to projects, especially since many roles will involve working collaboratively in teams.

# Contributions on GitHub Repos

Many repos on GitHub are open-source, meaning that GitHub members have the ability to suggest and contribute changes to a repo. Examples include, but are not limted to, debugging the source code, adding content to a README file, etc. To oversimplify the process of contributing to an open-source repo, one will first have to fork the repo (i.e., duplicate the repo into your own GitHub profile), make modifications to the duplicated repo, then request the owner of the original repo to make your desired modifications to the original repo (this is known as a pull request, where you are requesting the owner to merge your changes into the original repo). Of course, results may vary, and not all pull requests will be accepted.

**Repo Info:** This repo serves as a place to find special-made badges for a wide variety of technical tools, ranging from programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby) to communication tools (e.g., Gmail, MS Outlook) to Cloud technology (e.g., Azure, Oracle). These badges are special made for GitHub READMEs and can enhance the visual appeal of one's GitHub profile (see my profile repo for examples). 

**Tools/Languages Used:** Markdown

**Summary of Contribution:** The section "Spatial Software" did not include "ArcGIS", even though there exist a GitHub badge for ArcGIS. I therefore took it upon myself to fork the repo, add the badge, then submit a pull request.

**Impact:** The pull request was accepted, and is now part of the main repo. Users who have used ArcGIS and/or have working knowledge of it will now be able to use that badge template to add to their GitHub profile.

**Details of Contribution:**
